          Before you click “Apply now”, it helps to understand what issuers look at: income, existing debts, hard

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Happens When You Apply for a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card application is a <strong>request for a line of revolving credit</strong>. The issuer has to decide
        whether to offer you that credit, on what terms, and with what limit. To do that, they combine information from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The data you submit in the application form (income, housing, employment, etc.).</li>
        <li>Your credit report from one or more credit bureaus.</li>
        <li>Internal policies and risk models, which are not publicly disclosed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The decision is usually automated but can sometimes be sent to a manual review team, especially if your file is
        thin, complex or close to the issuer’s internal cut-off thresholds.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Eligibility -->
    <section id="eligibility" class="section">
      <h2>Eligibility Criteria and “Pre-Checks”</h2>
      <p>
        Every issuer has its own eligibility criteria, but common factors include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum age and residency</strong> in the country where the card is issued.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable income</strong>, sometimes with a minimum level for premium products.</li>
        <li><strong>Existing debts and utilization</strong> on other credit lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Past payment behaviour</strong> – late payments, defaults or collections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some websites offer “eligibility checkers” or “pre-qualification tools” that use a <strong>soft inquiry</strong>
        to estimate your chances without a full hard check. These tools are not guarantees, but they can help reduce
        unnecessary hard applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Hard inquiries -->
    <section id="inquiries" class="section">
      <h2>Hard Inquiries and Your Credit Score</h2>
      <p>
        A full application usually triggers a <strong>hard inquiry</strong> (also called a hard pull or hard search)
        on your credit report. This:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Becomes visible to other lenders for a period of time.</li>
        <li>Can lower your score slightly in the short term, especially if you apply for several cards within a short window.</li>
        <li>Is normally less important than payment history and utilization over the long term.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Multiple applications in rapid succession can make you look higher risk, even if you are not taking all the
        offers you’re approved for. It’s usually better to apply <strong>deliberately and spaced out</strong> in line
        with your goals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Approvals & rejections -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Approvals, Rejections and Reconsideration</h2>
      <p>
        Outcomes are typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Approved as requested</strong> – you get the card and limit you applied for (or similar).</li>
        <li><strong>Approved with changes</strong> – lower limit, different product, or extra conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Declined</strong> – the issuer decides not to offer you credit now.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many countries, issuers are required to give you a <strong>reason code</strong> for declines: for example,
        “too many recent inquiries”, “delinquent account” or “insufficient income”. These codes can help you understand
        what to improve before trying again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some lenders allow a <strong>reconsideration call</strong> where you can provide extra context, but policies vary
        and there is no guarantee of a changed decision.
      </p>

    <!-- When (not) to apply -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When It Makes Sense to Apply – and When to Wait</h2>
      <p>
        An application can make sense when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have a clear use-case (travel, FX, protections, rebuilding) and have compared alternatives.</li>
        <li>Your credit profile is stable, with on-time payments and reasonable utilization.</li>
        <li>You are not about to apply for a mortgage or large loan where every point of score matters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It can be better to wait if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You’ve had recent late payments or a default event.</li>
        <li>You’ve applied for several cards in a short period.</li>
        <li>You are unsure whether you can comfortably meet minimum payments.</li>
      </ul>
